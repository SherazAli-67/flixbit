App-Side Implementation - How Auto-Notifications Are Handled

ðŸ“± App-Side Architecture Overview
The app ONLY receives and displays notifications. It does NOT trigger or send them.

Backend (Cloud Functions) â”€â”€FCMâ”€â”€> Flutter App â”€â”€Displayâ”€â”€> User
       â†‘                                â†“
   Firestore Triggers            Handle & Route

1. Welcome Notification Flow - Backend (Already Deployed)
User scans QR â†’ onCreate trigger â†’ Cloud Function checks first scan
â†’ Sends FCM notification

2. Thank You Notification Flow
User redeems offer â†’ onCreate trigger â†’ Cloud Function sends FCM

3. Offer Reminder Flow
Daily cron job â†’ Checks expiring offers â†’ Sends FCM to unredeemed users

4. Re-engagement Notification Flow
Weekly cron job â†’ Finds inactive followers â†’ Sends FCM
