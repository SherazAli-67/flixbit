The Rewards System ties together predictions, offers, QR interactions, referrals, video contests, and seller marketing — it’s the “currency engine” that keeps the entire ecosystem active and rewarding.

Rewards System – Flixbit App Overview

⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Rewards System

The Rewards System in Flixbit is designed to:
	•	Encourage user participation and loyalty.
	•	Motivate users to engage with multiple features (predictions, ads, offers, referrals).
	•	Create a controlled in-app economy using Flixbit points (the digital currency).
	•	Allow sellers and admins to run promotions or contests that use rewards as incentives.

In short, rewards make Flixbit an interactive marketing ecosystem instead of a passive offers app.

🏗️ How the Rewards System Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

⸻

1. Reward Earning Mechanisms

Users can earn Flixbit points through various engagement activities:

a. Game Predictions
	•	Users predict outcomes in tournaments.
	•	Correct predictions earn points.
	•	Reaching certain accuracy thresholds unlocks bonus rewards.
	•	Points help users qualify for the final drawing (grand prize round).

b. Watching Video Ads
	•	Each video ad watched to completion earns small points (e.g., 5–10 Flixbits).
	•	Liking/disliking or sharing the video can add extra bonuses.

c. Video Contests
	•	Viewers earn points for voting or commenting.
	•	Video creators (sellers or influencers) earn rewards for high engagement and ratings.

d. Referrals
	•	Users invite friends via WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, etc.
	•	When a referred user joins and becomes active, both receive Flixbit points.

e. Offers and QR Scanning
	•	Users scanning a seller’s QR code and redeeming an offer earn points.
	•	Each QR interaction is linked to the seller and stored for future targeting.

f. Trivia Quizzes
	•	Correct answers in quiz contests give Flixbit points, ranked on leaderboards.

g. Reviews and Ratings
	•	Verified users reviewing sellers after offer redemption or ad viewing can earn Flixbits.

2. Reward Redemption

Flixbit points can be redeemed in two main ways:

🟢 Digital Rewards
	•	Coupons, promo codes, or downloadable vouchers.
	•	Instant redemption within the app.
	•	Example: “Redeem 50 Flixbit for a 10% Pizza Discount Coupon.”
	•	Delivered via in-app notification feed (no email/post).

📦 Physical Rewards
	•	Items like merchandise, electronics, or collectibles.
	•	Admin maintains inventory counts.
	•	Once redeemed, items appear in “My Rewards” section.
	•	Admin or Sub-Admin marks the item as shipped after fulfillment.

⸻

3. Reward Notification & Delivery
	•	Every time a user wins or redeems a reward:
	•	An in-app notification is sent to their feed (no email/postal).
	•	The reward also appears under Wallet → My Rewards tab.
	•	Notifications are localized (Arabic/English) and can include animations or QR links for redemption.

⸻

4. Reward Management (Admin/Sub-Admin Side)

Role         -  Responsibility
Admin        -  Add/manage rewards, set Flixbit value, control inventory, and approve high-value prizes.
Sub-Admin    -  Add local promotional rewards, manage redemption verification, and link rewards to regional events or tournaments.

Admin Dashboard Controls:
	•	Create new rewards (digital/physical).
	•	Define points required to redeem.
	•	Set reward availability (stock/inventory).
	•	Approve seller-sponsored rewards.
	•	Track reward redemptions and winners.
	•	Mark items as shipped.

5. Rewards Linked to Contests & Offers

Rewards are not isolated — they’re integrated across modules:

Module             -  Reward Connection
Game Prediction    -  Correct predictions give Flixbit points; top scorers win physical/digital rewards.
Video Contest      -  Winners and voters both earn Flixbit or coupons.
Offers & QR System -  Scanning/redeeming offers gives instant reward points.
Referral System    -  Inviter and invitee get Flixbits.
Trivia Quiz        -  Correct answers earn small Flixbit rewards.

This structure keeps users constantly earning and spending points.

⸻

6. Reward Value & Conversion System

Admin defines:
	•	💵 Value of each Flixbit (e.g., 1 Flixbit = $0.10).
	•	🏆 Minimum threshold for redemption (e.g., 100 Flixbits = $10 voucher).
	•	🎯 Dynamic reward rate (can vary for contests, offers, or ads).

This allows flexibility in controlling inflation within the app economy.

⸻

7. Reward Expiry and Recycling
	•	Each reward (especially digital coupons) may have an expiry date.
	•	Unclaimed or expired rewards return to the system inventory.
	•	Example:
	•	“Gift valid for 30 days — if unclaimed, it goes back to the sender’s account.”
(As mentioned in the client’s “wheel of fortune” gift system.)

⸻

8. Integration with Wheel of Fortune (Gift System)
	•	Users can send virtual gifts (e.g., $50 gift to a friend).
	•	The recipient spins a wheel to determine actual reward value.
	•	If unclaimed after a month → returned to sender’s wallet.
	•	Rewards are funded from ad revenue or Flixbit purchases.

This adds gamification and social sharing to the reward experience.

⸻

9. Reward Tracking & Analytics

Admin and Sub-Admin can track:
	•	Total Flixbit earned, redeemed, and in circulation.
	•	Most popular rewards (digital or physical).
	•	Redemption success rates.
	•	Top users by Flixbit balance.

Analytics are visualized in dashboard charts for economic health monitoring.

	7.	Gets notification → “Reward Redeemed Successfully.”
	8.	Seller confirms redemption; admin inventory auto-updates.

	•	Users buy Flixbit for entry into tournaments or faster redemption.
	•	Sellers sponsor rewards to promote products.
	•	Admin can sell premium reward placements or feature campaigns.
	•	Paid notifications and video ads feed the Flixbit economy.
