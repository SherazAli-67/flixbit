🌟 Reviews Section — Complete Explanation

⸻

🎯 Purpose

The Reviews Section allows:
	•	Users to rate and review sellers, offers, or services they’ve interacted with.
	•	Sellers to gain reputation, visibility, and attract more followers.
	•	Admins/Sub-Admins to track feedback quality, moderate inappropriate content, and promote top-rated sellers.

	•	Redeeming a coupon or offer from that seller.
	•	Participating in a prediction contest or event organized by that seller.
