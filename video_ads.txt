🎥 Video Ads Feature — Complete Explanation

🎯 Purpose

The Video Ads feature is designed to:
	•	Help sellers and advertisers promote their products or services.
	•	Reward users for watching, rating, or interacting with those videos.
	•	Increase engagement within the app through gamified advertising.

Essentially, it combines marketing + user incentives — users don’t just view ads; they get rewarded (Flixbit points, coupons, or contest entries) for engaging with them.

⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

1. Video Ad Creation (Seller or Sub-Admin Side)
	•	Sellers or Sub-Admins can upload promotional videos to the backend.
	•	These videos can be:
	•	Uploaded directly (MP4 file or YouTube/Vimeo link).
	•	Tagged with categories (e.g., restaurant, fitness, electronics).
	•	Linked to specific campaigns or offers.

Each video ad can have:
	•	Start and end date (ad campaign duration).
	•	Reward value (e.g., 5 Flixbit points for watching).
	•	Region targeting (e.g., only show in Dubai or Karachi).

⸻

2. Display to Users
	•	Videos appear:
	•	On the home screen (top section) in auto-play mode.
	•	In a dedicated “Video Ads” or “Watch & Earn” section.
	•	In push notifications, if part of a special campaign.

Users can browse and choose to watch video ads voluntarily — the app can also auto-play top ads like Instagram Reels or TikTok, keeping engagement high.

3. User Interaction & Reward System

When a user watches an ad:
	•	They must watch it completely (or for a minimum set duration).
	•	Once finished, they receive rewards like:
	•	Flixbit points added to their wallet.
	•	Discount coupons or vouchers from that seller.
	•	Qualification entries for contests (e.g., “watch 3 ads to join draw”).

Users can also:
	•	Rate the video (thumbs up or down).
	•	Leave brief feedback or comments (optional, for analytics).

Top-rated videos get more visibility in the app’s “Featured Ads” section — motivating sellers to create better quality content.

4. Video Contest Feature (Optional Extension)
	•	Some videos (especially from influencers or brands) can be part of a contest.
	•	Each video has:
	•	Start and end date for voting.
	•	Users can vote (thumbs up/down) during that period.
	•	Winners (videos with highest ratings) are announced by Admin/Sub-Admin.
	•	Both video creators and participating users can be rewarded.

⸻

5. Tracking & Analytics
	•	The backend tracks:
	•	How many users watched each video.
	•	Average watch time and completion rate.
	•	Ratings and engagement metrics.
	•	Sellers/Sub-Admins can view performance and adjust future campaigns.
