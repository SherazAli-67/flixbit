🏆 Tournament Management in Flixbit App

(User Side + Seller/Sub-Admin Side)

⸻

🎯 Purpose

The Tournament Management System is the heart of Flixbit’s gamification model.
It allows:
	•	Sub-admins/sellers to organize and manage prediction-based tournaments.
	•	Users to participate in those tournaments by making predictions and earning rewards or Flixbit points.

It turns regular sports events (football, cricket, basketball, etc.) into interactive prediction contests — helping drive engagement, app traffic, and marketing exposure for sellers.

⚙️ A. Seller / Sub-Admin Side — Tournament Creation & Management

The tournament lifecycle begins from the Seller/Sub-Admin panel (backend).

⸻

1. Tournament Creation

A Sub-Admin (or seller with permission) creates tournaments from their backend dashboard.

Information entered:
	•	Tournament name (e.g., “World Cup Predictions 2025”).
	•	Sport type (Football, Cricket, etc.).
	•	Description (optional).
	•	Start and end date.
	•	Number of matches.
	•	Prediction type (Winner only / Scoreline / Player stats).
	•	Points per correct prediction (e.g., 10 Flixbit each).
	•	Minimum accuracy for qualification (e.g., 80%).
	•	Entry type (Free or Paid using Flixbit).
	•	Associated rewards (Physical / Digital).

🟢 Result: A tournament is published and visible to users in the “Predictions” or “Contests” section.

⸻

2. Grouping & Organization

Sub-Admin can group multiple tournaments by:
	•	Region or city (e.g., Dubai League, Riyadh League).
	•	Seller partnerships (e.g., Sponsored by XYZ Brand).
	•	Category (Football, Basketball, etc.).

This helps them manage multiple contests efficiently and send targeted notifications.

⸻

3. Match Management

For each tournament, Sub-Admin adds individual matches:
	•	Team A vs Team B
	•	Match date and time
	•	Match location (optional)
	•	Match ID or code

When matches are added, users can start making predictions.

⸻

4. Score Updates & Results

After each match:
	•	The Sub-Admin updates the final score manually (or automatically via integrated API, if implemented later).
	•	The system recalculates:
	•	Each user’s prediction accuracy.
	•	Total Flixbit points earned.
	•	Qualification status for the final draw.

⸻

5. Reward Distribution Setup

Sub-Admin can:
	•	Define reward tiers (Top 3 winners, random draw, etc.).
	•	Attach digital or physical rewards to specific outcomes.
	•	Decide if rewards are given:
	•	Automatically via in-app wallet or
	•	Manually (physical items marked “shipped”).

⸻

6. Sponsor / Seller Involvement

Some tournaments are sponsored by sellers:
	•	Seller’s brand name appears in the tournament listing (e.g., “Sponsored by ABC Store”).
	•	The seller may fund rewards or give exclusive coupons to winners.
	•	This gives them visibility while driving real traffic to their business.

⸻

7. Tournament Analytics

Sub-Admin/Seller Dashboard shows:
	•	Total participants.
	•	Correct prediction ratio.
	•	Number of users qualified (≥80%).
	•	Flixbit points awarded.
	•	Redemption history.
	•	Revenue (if users bought points for entry).

3. Making Predictions
