üåü Flixbit ‚Äì Complete App Overview

üéØ App Concept

Flixbit is a marketing and engagement platform that combines:
‚Ä¢	Game prediction contests,
‚Ä¢	Reward-based marketing,
‚Ä¢	QR code‚Äìdriven tracking,
‚Ä¢	Coupons and loyalty systems, and
‚Ä¢	Location-based push notifications.

It connects users (buyers) and sellers (businesses/influencers) under one system ‚Äî allowing sellers to promote their offers and users to earn or redeem Flixbit rewards through predictions, referrals, and purchases.

‚Ä¢	Sub-Admins update the actual match results, and the system calculates winners automatically.
‚Ä¢	Admin defines:
‚Ä¢	Points per correct answer,
‚Ä¢	Flixbit value (e.g., $0.10/point),
‚Ä¢	Final prizes, and
‚Ä¢	Number of winners.
