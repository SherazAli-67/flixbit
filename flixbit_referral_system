Referral System is another crucial and revenue-driving part of the Flixbit app, because it connects users, sellers, and the platform’s reward ecosystem in a viral, self-promoting loop.

 Referral System Integration – Flixbit App Overview

⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Referral System

The Referral System is designed to help Flixbit grow organically by rewarding users and sellers for inviting others.

It promotes network-based marketing, ensuring:
	•	More app downloads and activity,
	•	More seller visibility and followers,
	•	And a continuous increase in user engagement through Flixbit points and offers.

It ties deeply with the Wallet, Rewards, Push Notifications, and QR Systems to track and reward referrals accurately.

⸻

⚙️ Core Concept

Every user and seller has a unique referral identity, represented by either:
	•	A referral code,
	•	A referral link, or
	•	A referral QR code.

When a new user joins through one of these, the system automatically:
	1.	Tracks the referral source,
	2.	Awards Flixbit points or bonus rewards to both parties, and
	3.	Updates the referral analytics in the backend.

⸻

👤 User Side – Referral Features

1. Referral Invitation Options

Users can invite friends through:
	•	WhatsApp
	•	Telegram
	•	Facebook
	•	Instagram
	•	Contact List (direct sharing)
	•	Or by showing their QR code to be scanned in person.

Each method carries their unique referral code or link, allowing precise tracking.

⸻

2. Earning Rewards for Referrals

When a new user installs the app and signs up through an existing user’s referral:
	•	The referrer (existing user) receives Flixbit points in their wallet.
	•	The referred user (new user) may receive a welcome reward (bonus Flixbits or coupon).

Example:

Ahmed refers his friend Saif using WhatsApp.
Saif installs and signs up → Ahmed earns 20 Flixbit points, Saif earns 10 as a welcome bonus.

⸻

3. Referral Conditions & Validation
	•	The new user must complete registration and verification for the referral to count.
	•	Duplicate devices or accounts are not rewarded.
	•	If the referred user engages actively (e.g., joins a tournament or redeems offers), bonus rewards can be triggered.

⸻

4. Wallet Integration
	•	All referral points are added directly to the Flixbit Wallet.
	•	Transaction details (date, referral name, earned points) appear in the wallet’s transaction history.
	•	Users can redeem those points for offers, contests, or prizes.

⸻

5. Referral Dashboard (User App Section)

Users can view:
	•	Total referrals made
	•	Total points earned from referrals
	•	Pending invitations
	•	Links to share their referral code again

⸻

6. Notifications

Users receive:
	•	Notifications when a referred friend joins successfully.
	•	Bonus reward notifications if the referred friend performs specific actions (e.g., purchases points, joins a tournament).

⸻

🏪 Seller Side – Referral Integration

For sellers, the referral system works in two main ways:
	1.	Attracting new followers (users)
	2.	Connecting with other sellers or influencers

⸻

1. Seller Referral QR Codes
	•	Each seller receives a unique referral QR linked to their business profile.
	•	When users scan it, they:
	•	Follow that seller automatically.
	•	Get Flixbit points or special offer rewards.

This system turns physical QR campaigns into referral-based marketing tools.

⸻

2. Influencer or Partner Referrals
	•	Sellers can collaborate with influencers who share the seller’s referral QR/link.
	•	Each scan or signup via that link rewards both the influencer and the seller with points or ad credits.

Example:

Influencer promotes a restaurant’s QR code → followers scan → restaurant gains followers → influencer earns commission points.

⸻

3. Seller Referral Benefits
	•	Gain verified followers who can receive future notifications and offers.
	•	Earn bonus Flixbit or advertising credits for high referral engagement.
	•	Build brand credibility via the app’s ranking and reward systems.

⸻

4. Seller Analytics

In their dashboard, sellers can see:
	•	Total number of referrals made via QR or link.
	•	Conversion rates (how many scanned → registered → followed).
	•	Reward distribution summaries.

⸻

👑 Admin & Sub-Admin Side – Referral System Management

Admins and Sub-Admins have full control and visibility over referral operations.

⸻

1. Referral Program Setup

Admin configures:
	•	Default Flixbit reward values (for both referrer and referred).
	•	Conditions for valid referrals (minimum activity requirements).
	•	Bonus programs for top referrers or regional events.

Example:

“Refer 10 active users this month and get 500 Flixbit bonus.”

⸻

2. Tracking & Analytics

Admin/Sub-Admin dashboards include:
	•	Total referrals system-wide.
	•	Top referring users and sellers.
	•	Referral conversion rates.
	•	Flixbit economy impact from referrals.
	•	Fraud detection reports (duplicate referrals, fake accounts).

⸻

3. Regional Referral Control (Sub-Admin)

Each Sub-Admin can:
	•	Track referrals within their assigned city/region.
	•	Create local referral campaigns with special rewards.
	•	Manage seller-based referral events and QR codes.

Example:

Sub-Admin for Dubai launches “Refer & Win Weekend” → tracks results locally.

⸻

4. Reward Approval & Automation

Admins control:
	•	Whether referral rewards are instant or manual approval.
	•	Set reward thresholds or referral limits per user to prevent abuse.
	•	Automatically add earned rewards to wallets upon approval.

⸻

5. Fraud Prevention
	•	System uses device and IP checks to detect fake referrals.
	•	Only unique, verified users count.
	•	Admin can revoke points for invalid or suspicious referrals.
