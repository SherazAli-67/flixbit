🎯 Purpose

The Offers System is the marketing backbone of Flixbit.
It allows:
	•	Sellers to promote their products or services to nearby users.
	•	Users to discover, redeem, and share offers within the app.

⚙️ How Offers Work (Step-by-Step)

⸻

1. Offer Creation (Seller Side)

When a seller registers and logs into their dashboard or mobile interface, they can create new offers.

Each offer includes:
	•	Offer title (e.g., “20% off Lunch Combo”).
	•	Description (details of the deal).
	•	Offer type:
	•	Discount offer (percentage or fixed value).
	•	Coupon / Voucher (digital code or redeemable QR).
	•	Special Deal / Bundle (e.g., buy 2 get 1 free).
	•	Offer category (Food, Fashion, Electronics, etc.).
	•	Offer image or video (optional).
	•	Validity dates (start & end).
	•	Maximum redemptions per user or total stock.
	•	Target location or audience (by city or radius).

📌 Once created, the offer is submitted to the Admin/Sub-Admin for approval before being visible to users.

⸻

2. Offer Approval (Admin/Sub-Admin)

To maintain authenticity and prevent misuse, all offers are reviewed and approved by Admin/Sub-Admin.

They verify:
	•	Offer accuracy and legitimacy.
	•	Pricing and validity period.
	•	Seller’s active status and QR verification.

After approval, the offer appears live on the user app.

⸻

3. Offer Visibility (User Side)

Users can view offers through multiple sections:
Location                       -       Description
🏠 Home Screen Dashboard       -       Latest offers in user’s area or from followed sellers.
🎟️ Offers Section / Tab        -       Dedicated tab listing all active offers, with sorting by “Nearest,” “Latest,” “Top Rated,” etc.
🔍 Search or Filter            -       Search offers by category, keywords, or city.
🔔 Push Notifications          -       Auto or manual notifications promote specific offers based on demographics.
🏪 Seller Profile Page         -       Shows all active offers from that seller.


4. Offer Redemption

Users can redeem offers in two ways:

🟢 A. QR Code Redemption
	•	Each offer generates a unique QR code.
	•	When a user visits the store, they scan the seller’s QR.
	•	The app validates redemption and marks it as “Used.”
	•	The seller can track which user redeemed the offer.

🟢 B. In-App Coupon Redemption
	•	The offer includes a digital coupon code.
	•	User clicks “Redeem” in the app.
	•	The code or voucher is displayed for use online or at checkout.

Once redeemed, the offer is:
	•	Added to user’s redemption history.
	•	Deducted from available redemptions (for inventory tracking).

⸻

5. Offer Rewards Integration

Each offer can optionally reward users with Flixbit points.

Example:
	•	“Redeem this offer and earn 10 Flixbit points.”
	•	“Watch a short video and get a 15% off coupon.”

This feature encourages users to engage with the marketing content while benefiting from rewards.

⸻

6. Push Notification Targeting

The Offers System works closely with push notifications:
	•	Admin/Sub-Admin or Sellers can send auto or manual notifications promoting new offers.
	•	Notifications are customized based on:
	•	User’s location (city or radius).
	•	Interests (e.g., food, fashion, sports).
	•	Active times (specific hours or recurring frequency).

Example:

“Hey Ali! A new 25% discount at Pizza House near you — valid today only 🍕.”

This creates a personalized marketing experience similar to Facebook’s local targeting model.

⸻

7. Offer Tracking & Analytics

For every offer, the backend tracks:
	•	Number of views and redemptions.
	•	Locations where it performed best.
	•	Users who redeemed or interacted.
	•	Ratings and reviews for the seller or offer.

Sellers and Sub-Admins can view this in their dashboards.

Admins can see platform-wide insights:
	•	Top-performing sellers.
	•	Total offers redeemed.
	•	Conversion rate from notifications to redemptions.

⸻

8. Seller Follower Connection

When a user redeems or scans an offer, they automatically become a follower of that seller.
	•	This lets the seller send them future notifications.
	•	Builds a loyal customer list for remarketing.

Example:

A user redeems a 10% discount from a gym → now automatically follows that gym’s future offers.

⸻

9. Offers + QR + Wallet Flow Example

Example Scenario:
	1.	Seller “PizzaHub” creates an offer → “Buy 1 Get 1 Free Pizza.”
	2.	Admin approves it.
	3.	Users nearby get a push notification.
	4.	User visits PizzaHub → scans QR code → redeem offer.
	5.	User earns 10 Flixbit points for redemption.
	6.	Seller gains a new follower.
	7.	Admin dashboard logs all redemptions and engagement data.
