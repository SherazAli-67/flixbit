QR System Integration ‚Äì Flixbit App Overview

‚∏ª

üéØ Purpose of the QR System

The QR system in Flixbit links users, sellers, and rewards under one ecosystem.

It serves multiple purposes:
	‚Ä¢	To connect users and sellers instantly.
	‚Ä¢	To track offers, redemptions, and referrals.
	‚Ä¢	To send targeted push notifications to users who scan a seller‚Äôs QR.
	‚Ä¢	To redeem loyalty points, coupons, or rewards directly through scanning.
	‚Ä¢	To monitor marketing performance through admin/sub-admin analytics.

In short ‚Äî QR codes make every seller, user, and campaign trackable, measurable, and re-targetable.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

Every seller and every offer has a unique QR code generated by the app.
These QR codes are scanned by users, which triggers:
	1.	Linking the user to that seller.
	2.	Recording the scan in the database (for analytics & marketing).
	3.	Awarding points or coupons (depending on context).
	4.	Allowing targeted notifications to that specific user group.

‚∏ª

üßë‚Äçüíº Seller Side (QR System Functions)

Each seller in Flixbit has their own unique QR code generated upon registration.

1. Seller QR Code Generation
	‚Ä¢	Automatically generated during seller registration.
	‚Ä¢	Linked to the seller‚Äôs unique ID in the database.
	‚Ä¢	Can be downloaded or displayed inside the seller‚Äôs dashboard for printing or sharing.

Example:

‚∏ª

2. Offer-Based QR Codes
	‚Ä¢	Every offer created by the seller also generates a specific QR code.
	‚Ä¢	This QR code connects directly to that offer‚Äôs redemption page in the app.

Example:

Offer: ‚ÄúBuy 1 Get 1 Free‚Äù ‚Üí QR generated ‚Üí customer scans ‚Üí offer is redeemed & tracked.

‚∏ª

3. Tracking Followers & Engagement

	‚Ä¢	The seller can see how many users scanned their QR.
	‚Ä¢	The app automatically adds the user to the seller‚Äôs followers list.
	‚Ä¢	Followers become part of that seller‚Äôs notification audience.

This gives sellers a live follower count and interaction history.

‚∏ª

4. Push Notification Targeting

After a QR is scanned:
	‚Ä¢	The seller can send custom offers or reminders to those users.
	‚Ä¢	Notifications can be auto-scheduled or manual.

Example:

100 users scanned ‚ÄúPizzaHub‚Äôs‚Äù QR this week ‚Üí PizzaHub sends a push notification ‚Üí ‚Äú50% off for our followers today!‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	When the user scans the QR, it marks the reward as claimed in the system.
